# üí° What is LMCache?

TL;DR - Redis for LLMs. 

LMCache is a **LLM** serving engine extension to **reduce TTFT** and **increase throughput**, especially under long-context scenarios. By storing the KV caches of reusable texts across various locations including (GPU, CPU DRAM, Local Disk), LMCache reuse the KV caches of **_any_** reused text (not necessarily prefix) in **_any_** serving engine instance. Thus, LMCache saves precious GPU cycles and reduces response delay for users.  

By combining LMCache with vLLM, LMCaches achieves 3-10x delay savings and GPU cycle reduction in many LLM use cases, including multi-round QA and RAG.

Try LMCache with pre-built vllm docker images [here](https://docs.lmcache.ai/getting_started/docker.html).
